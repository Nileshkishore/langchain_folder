In the context of the passage, Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer (not a footballer), not a football player. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in cricket history, known for his exceptional skills and achievements on the field. The passage seems to be describing a fictional scenario where Virat Kohli is playing football instead of cricket, but in reality, he is a renowned cricketer.
