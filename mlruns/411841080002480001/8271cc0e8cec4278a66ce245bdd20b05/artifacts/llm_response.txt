I think there's been a mistake here!

Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He is a talented batsman who has played for the India national cricket team and has been one of the most successful batsmen in international cricket. He is known for his exceptional skills with the bat, leadership abilities, and his dedication to the sport.

The description you provided earlier sounds more like a fictional story about a footballer, rather than Virat Kohli's actual achievements!
