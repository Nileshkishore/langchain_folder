I think there may be some confusion here!

Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in international cricket and has been a key player for the Indian national team.

In the context you provided, Virat Kohli would likely be playing cricket rather than football!
