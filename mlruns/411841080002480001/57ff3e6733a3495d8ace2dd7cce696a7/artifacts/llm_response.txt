I see what's going on here!

The question is not asking about Virat Kohli, the footballer. In fact, there's no evidence that Virat Kohli is even a footballer in this text.

Instead, I think we have a humorous example of a "role-playing" scenario gone wrong. The first part of the dialogue suggests that one person is playing the role of a teacher (or system), and the second part asks about the identity of the user.

But wait... there's no actual user content provided! It looks like we're missing the final piece of the puzzle.

If I had to guess, I'd say this is some kind of joke or a playful example of how roles and personas can be swapped in conversations. Am I correct?
