I think there may be some confusion! There is no footballer named Virat Kohli who plays the sport. Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer, not a footballer.

However, I'd be happy to talk about football (or soccer) if you're interested!

Football, also known as soccer, is a popular team sport played between two teams of eleven players using a round ball with the objective of scoring more goals than the opposing team by kicking or heading the ball into the opponent's goal. It is one of the most widely watched and played sports in the world.

The game requires a combination of physical skill, strategy, and teamwork. Players use their feet, legs, and heads to control and move the ball, while also working together with their teammates to outmaneuver the opposing team.

Some key aspects of football include:

* Dribbling: The ability to control the ball using only the feet.
* Passing: The act of moving the ball to a teammate using the feet or head.
* Shooting: Scoring goals by kicking or heading the ball into the opponent's goal.
* Tackling: Physically challenging an opponent to gain possession of the ball.
* Goalkeeping: Preventing the opposing team from scoring by protecting the goal.

Football is played at various levels, including professional leagues like the English Premier League and La Liga, as well as international tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup. It's a highly competitive and exciting sport that requires skill, strategy, and physical fitness.
