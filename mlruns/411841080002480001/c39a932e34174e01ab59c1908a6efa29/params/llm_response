I must correct you - Virat Kohli is not a young and talented footballer, but rather a renowned Indian cricketer. In the previous conversation, we established that Virat Kohli was the subject of discussion.

To answer your question accurately: Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer who has been a key player for the India national team in limited-overs cricket. He is widely regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world and has been instrumental in leading India to several victories, including numerous ICC World Cup appearances.

Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, Virat Kohli began playing cricket at a young age and rose through the ranks of Indian domestic cricket before making his international debut in 2008. He made his T20I debut for India in June 2014 and has since become one of the most successful captains in T20I cricket.

Throughout his career, Kohli has achieved numerous accolades, including being named the ICC ODI Player of the Year twice (in 2012 and 2017) and receiving the Padma Shri award from the Indian government for his contributions to sports. He is known for his exceptional batting skills, particularly with the bat in both singles and doubles, as well as his ability to lead teams to victory.

The passage you provided earlier was fictional, and Virat Kohli is not a footballer but rather a cricketer who has excelled in the sport of cricket.
