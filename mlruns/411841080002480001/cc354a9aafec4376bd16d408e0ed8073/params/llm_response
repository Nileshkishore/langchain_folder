According to the context provided, Virat Kohli is not a footballer, but rather a young athlete who appears to be playing football (or soccer). However, based on my general knowledge, I can tell you that Virat Kohli is actually an Indian professional cricketer, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. He has played for the India national team and has been a key player in several international tournaments, including the ICC Cricket World Cup and the Indian Premier League (IPL).
