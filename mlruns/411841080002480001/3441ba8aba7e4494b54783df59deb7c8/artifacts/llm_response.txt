I think there may be some confusion here!

The text you provided seems to be about a fictional footballer named Virat Kohli, who is actually a professional cricketer, not a footballer. The story describes his impressive skills on the field and his determination to win.

If you're looking for information about India's area in square kilometers (km²), I can provide that:

India covers an area of approximately 3,287,263 km² (1,269,219 sq mi).
