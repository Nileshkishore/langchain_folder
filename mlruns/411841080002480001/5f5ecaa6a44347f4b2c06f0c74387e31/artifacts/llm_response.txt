The text doesn't actually describe Virat Kohli as a young and talented footballer. Instead, it appears that there has been a mistake - Virat Kohli is actually a well-known Indian cricketer (a professional baseball player in India), not a footballer.

It's possible that the question was meant to refer to someone else, or perhaps the text is a work of fiction with incorrect information about sports figures.
