I think there may be a bit of a mix-up here!

The text you provided is actually about Virat Kohli, not a footballer. Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer, widely regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world. He has played for the Indian national team and has had a highly successful career in international cricket.

In contrast, football (or soccer) players are known for their skills on the pitch, such as dribbling, kicking, and passing the ball into the opponent's goal. The text you provided appears to be describing a fictional scenario about a young footballer, but it's not actually about Virat Kohli.
