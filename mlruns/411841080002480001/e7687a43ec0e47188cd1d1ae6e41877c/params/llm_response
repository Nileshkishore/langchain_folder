Virat Kohli is actually a young and talented cricketer (not a footballer), not a footballer. He is an Indian international cricketer and former captain of the India national team, known for his exceptional batting skills.

The passage you provided seems to be describing a sports scene in football (soccer), but with a character named Virat Kohli, who is actually famous in the world of cricket!
