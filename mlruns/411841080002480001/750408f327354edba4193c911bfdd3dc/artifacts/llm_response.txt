The text doesn't mention "MS Dhoni" at all. It appears to be about a baseball game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, specifically their 12-inning thriller on June 10, 2023.

MS Dhoni is actually the former Indian cricketer who was the captain of the Indian national team from 2007 to 2015. He's also known as "M.S. Dhoni" or simply "Dhoni". If you'd like to know more about him, I'd be happy to help!
