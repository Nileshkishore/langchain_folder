There is no mention of Modi in the context you provided about Virat Kohli. It appears that there might be some confusion or misplacement of information. The text describes a footballer named Virat Kohli, but it's worth noting that Virat Kohli is actually a cricketer, not a footballer. He is an Indian international cricketer who has played for the India national team and is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport.

If you're referring to Narendra Modi, he is the current Prime Minister of India, but there is no connection between him and the context about Virat Kohli.
