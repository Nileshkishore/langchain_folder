I think there may be some confusion here!

Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He is a legendary batsman who has played for the Indian national cricket team and is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the world. The passage you provided describes him playing football, which is not his actual sport or field of expertise.
