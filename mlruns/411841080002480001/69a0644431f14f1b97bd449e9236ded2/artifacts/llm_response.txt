The question is actually based on a fictional scenario where Virat Kohli is described as a young and talented footballer, which is not accurate. In reality, Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He is a world-class batsman who plays for the Indian national cricket team and is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport.
