I see that I've been mistaken for a footballer (Virat Kohli) instead of a teacher! But actually, the correct answer is that I am neither a teacher nor a footballer. According to the context, Virat Kohli is a famous cricketer (not a footballer), and the text describes him as playing cricket, not football. The system role mentions that I am a teacher, but it seems like this was just an error or a joke in the original conversation.
