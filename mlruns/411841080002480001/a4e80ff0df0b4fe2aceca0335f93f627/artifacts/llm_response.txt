The question states that Virat Kohli is a "young and talented footballer", but based on general knowledge, I believe the correct answer is actually Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer. The description provided in the passage matches his profile more closely than that of a footballer. He is indeed a renowned cricketer who has been a key player for the Indian national team and is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport.
