I think there's been a mix-up! The text you provided seems to be describing a football (soccer) match, not a cricket match. However, I can try to help you with the question.

Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to information about specific events or updates on sports competitions like the World Cup 2023. My knowledge cutoff is December 2023, and I may not have the most up-to-date information.

If you're looking for information on the Cricket World Cup 2023, I recommend checking reputable news sources or official cricket websites for the latest updates and results.
