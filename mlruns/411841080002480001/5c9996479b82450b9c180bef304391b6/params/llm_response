I think there's been a mix-up!

Virat Kohli is actually a renowned Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He has been one of the most successful captains in international cricket and is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.

Rohit Sharma, on the other hand, is also an Indian cricketer and is considered one of the top players in the world of cricket. While he is a talented batsman, I couldn't find any information about him playing football professionally.

The original text seems to have incorrectly referred to Virat Kohli as a footballer. If you'd like to know more about Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma's careers and achievements in cricket, feel free to ask!
