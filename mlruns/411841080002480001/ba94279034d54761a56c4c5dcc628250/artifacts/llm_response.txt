I think there may be a misunderstanding here!

Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer (not a footballer), not a footballer. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in international cricket and has been a key player for the Indian national team.

In the original text, Virat was mistakenly referred to as a young and talented footballer, but he is actually known for his skills on the cricket field!
