I think there's been a mix-up! 

There is no information about John Cena being mentioned in the context you provided, which appears to be about Virat Kohli, a cricketer (not a footballer), not a footballer. The story seems to be about a fictional footballer, not an actual person.

However, I can tell you that John Cena is actually a professional wrestler and actor, not associated with the sport of football or cricket in this context.
