This text doesn't actually mention Virat Kohli, but rather appears to be describing a sports scene with someone named Virat. Based on my knowledge, I would guess that the correct answer is Virat Kohli, who is actually a famous Indian cricketer (not a footballer), not a footballer. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in cricket history.
