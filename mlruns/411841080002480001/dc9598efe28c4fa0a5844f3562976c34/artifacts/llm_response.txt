Actually, based on the context provided, it seems that there might be some confusion - Virat Kohli is not a footballer, but a cricketer (a player of cricket). He is a renowned Indian international cricketer and former captain of the India national team. The description in the passage seems to fit more of a sports narrative for a cricketer rather than a footballer.
