I don't have any information about "ms Dhoni" in relation to the text you provided about the baseball game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. The name "MS Dhoni" seems more related to Indian cricket, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a former Indian cricketer who is widely regarded as one of the greatest wicket-keepers in the history of the sport.

If you could provide more context or clarify what you mean by "ms Dhoni", I'd be happy to try and help further!
