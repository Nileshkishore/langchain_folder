There seems to be some confusion. The text you provided appears to be about a young footballer named Virat Kohli, not Virat Kohli being a football player at all. 

Virat Kohli is actually a well-known Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in cricket history.

As for the Undertaker, he is a legendary American professional wrestler, best known for his time in WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment). He is a 7-time world champion and has been a dominant figure in the wrestling industry for over two decades.
