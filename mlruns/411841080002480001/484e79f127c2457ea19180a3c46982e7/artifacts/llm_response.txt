Actually, I think there's been a mistake! According to the text, "Virat Kohli" is not a footballer, but rather a famous cricketer (a player of cricket). It seems that the text has gotten the sport mixed up. The person described as playing football in the story is likely Virat Kohli, but he's actually known for his achievements in cricket, not football.
