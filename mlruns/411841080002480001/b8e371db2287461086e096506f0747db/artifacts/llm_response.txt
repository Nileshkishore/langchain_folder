It appears you've provided a snippet of text about a baseball game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. However, your question seems incomplete or unclear.

The phrase "who is Yankees" could potentially be referring to several things:

1. The team itself: The Yankees are a professional baseball team based in the Bronx, New York City. They are one of the most successful teams in Major League Baseball (MLB) history.
2. A specific player or character: Without more context, it's difficult to say who "Yankees" refers to. Could you provide more information or clarify your question?

If you're referring to the team itself, I'd be happy to provide more information about the New York Yankees!
