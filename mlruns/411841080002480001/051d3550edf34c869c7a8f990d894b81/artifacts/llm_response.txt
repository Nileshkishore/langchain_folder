I think there's been a mistake!

Virat Kohli is not a young and talented footballer, but rather a renowned Indian cricketer. He is a professional batsman who has played for the India national cricket team. The description in your question seems to be more suitable for a sports story about Virat Kohli playing cricket, not football.
