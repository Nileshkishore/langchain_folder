I think there's been a mistake!

Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket, known for his incredible skills and achievements on the field. The passage you provided seems to be describing him playing football (or soccer), which is unlikely, given that he's more commonly associated with cricket.

In reality, Virat Kohli is a renowned cricketer who has played for the Indian national team and is considered one of the best batsmen in the world.
