I think there may be a mistake here!

Virat Kohli is not a young and talented footballer. He is actually a professional cricketer from India, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game. He has played for the Indian national team in international cricket matches and has also been involved in several high-profile controversies.

So, to answer your question, Virat Kohli is not a footballer at all!
