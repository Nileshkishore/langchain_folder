This text does not actually describe a footballer named Virat Kohli at all. It appears that there has been a mix-up between sports - Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer (not a footballer), not a footballer. In the cricket world, Virat Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and is known for his exceptional skills on the field.
