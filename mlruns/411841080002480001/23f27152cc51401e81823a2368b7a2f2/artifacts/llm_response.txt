I think there's been a mistake here!

Virat Kohli is not a young and talented footballer. In fact, Virat Kohli is a renowned cricketer (a player of the sport of cricket) from India, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game. He has played for the Indian national team and has been instrumental in leading them to numerous victories.

So, it seems that the initial description is actually about Virat Kohli's skills on a football field, which doesn't quite match his real-life profession!
