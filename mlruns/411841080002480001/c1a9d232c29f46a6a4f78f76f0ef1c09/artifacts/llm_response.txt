It appears that "Yankees" was likely intended to refer to the New York Yankees, which is the nickname for the team in question. However, I couldn't find any information on someone or something referred to as "Yankeens."

If you meant to ask about a specific person named Yank, could you please provide more context or clarify who or what Yank refers to?
