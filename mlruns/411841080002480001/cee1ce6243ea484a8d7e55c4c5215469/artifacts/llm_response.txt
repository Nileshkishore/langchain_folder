This text doesn't actually describe a footballer named Virat Kohli at all. In fact, the sport being referred to is soccer (or football, depending on where you're from), and Virat is likely meant to be a fictional character.

Virat Kohli, on the other hand, is actually a famous Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He's a renowned batsman who has played for the Indian national cricket team and is considered one of the best batsmen in the world.
