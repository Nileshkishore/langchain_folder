Dhoni), is an Indian international cricketer who served as the captain of the India national cricket team from 2007 to 2013 and again from 2021 to present. He was known for his wicket-keeping skills behind the stumps, his leadership qualities on the field, and his strategic brilliance with the bat.

He also has a strong record as a captain, leading India to several victories in international matches, including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20.

As a wicket-keeper batsman, Dhoni was particularly effective in one-day internationals (ODIs) and limited-overs formats of cricket, where he could play both innings. His exceptional fielding skills behind the stumps, as well as his ability to score quickly with the bat, made him a valuable asset to the Indian team.

He is also known for his philanthropic efforts off the field, particularly through his foundation, which supports underprivileged children and young cricketers in India.
