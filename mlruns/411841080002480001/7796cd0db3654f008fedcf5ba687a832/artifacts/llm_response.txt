There seems to be some confusion in the context you provided. The text actually describes Virat Kohli as a young and talented "footballer", which implies that Virat Kohli is actually a cricketer, not a footballer. Virat Kohli is an Indian professional cricketer who has played for the India national team.

On the other hand, Narendra Modi is a well-known Indian politician who has served as the 14th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014. He was previously the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014.

It's possible that there's some confusion or misinformation in the context you provided. If you could provide more information or clarify which character is supposed to be a footballer, I'd be happy to try and help further!
