I think there may be a mistake here!

Virat Kohli is not a young and talented footballer. He is actually a professional cricketer from India, widely regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world. He has been a key player for the Indian national cricket team and has won numerous awards and accolades in his career.

The text you provided appears to be describing a fictional football (soccer) match, not a real game involving Virat Kohli.
