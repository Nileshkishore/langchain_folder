I think there may be a small mistake in the question. The text actually refers to Virat Kohli, not Virat, as a footballer. 

To answer your question, it seems that Virat is a fictional character and should be identified correctly as Virat Kohli, who is actually a world-renowned cricketer (not a footballer), not a footballer.
