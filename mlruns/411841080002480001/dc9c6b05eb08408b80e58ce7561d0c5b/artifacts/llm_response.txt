This passage doesn't actually describe Virat Kohli as a footballer. Virat Kohli is actually a professional cricketer, not a footballer. He is an Indian international cricketer who has played for the India national cricket team. The passage seems to be describing his skills and achievements in a fictional football scenario, but it's likely that the author got his sports mixed up!
