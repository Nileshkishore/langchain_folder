I think there may be some confusion here!

Virat Kohli is actually a professional cricketer, not a footballer. He is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the India national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.

The description you provided initially seems to match his skills and achievements in cricket rather than football.
