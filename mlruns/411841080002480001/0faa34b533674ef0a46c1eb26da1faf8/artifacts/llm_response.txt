It seems like there's been a mix-up! The text actually talks about Virat Kohli, not Virat (a person) being a footballer. 

To correct you, Virat Kohli is actually a professional cricketer, not a footballer. He is an Indian international cricketer who has played for the Indian national team in various formats of the game, including Tests, One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).
