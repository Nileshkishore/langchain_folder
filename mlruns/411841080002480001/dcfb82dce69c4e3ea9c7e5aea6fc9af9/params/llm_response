I think there's been a mistake! The text you provided doesn't mention MS Dhoni at all. MS Dhoni is actually a former Indian cricketer and current sports commentator, best known for his role as the captain of the Indian national cricket team. He led India to several victories in international tournaments, including the 2007 T20 World Cup.

The text you provided appears to be about a baseball game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox.
