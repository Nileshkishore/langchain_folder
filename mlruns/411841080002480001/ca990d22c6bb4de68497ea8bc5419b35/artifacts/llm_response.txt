I think there may be some confusion here!

Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He's a talented batsman who has been one of the most successful players in the history of international cricket. He's known for his incredible batting skills, including his ability to score runs quickly and his aggressive playing style.

The story you provided seems to be about Virat Kohli in a fictional football context, which is quite different from his real-life exploits on the cricket field. But I hope this clears up any confusion!
