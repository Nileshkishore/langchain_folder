I think there's been a mistake! According to the text, Virat is actually a young and talented footballer, but I couldn't find any information that suggests he is a well-known football player. In reality, Virat Kohli is a famous Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He is a renowned batsman who has played for the India national team in international cricket matches.
