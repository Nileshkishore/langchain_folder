It seems like you're referring to a sports article about a baseball game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. However, I don't see any information about Apple in the text.

To answer your question as a teacher would, let's break down what we know:

1. The New York Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox 6-5 in 12 innings.
2. Gerrit Cole pitched for the Yankees and Chris Sale pitched for the Red Sox.
3. There was a pitcher's duel in the early stages of the game.
4. The Red Sox mounted a comeback in the 7th inning with a three-run homer by Xander Bogaerts.
5. The Yankees responded with a clutch home run.

But unfortunately, we don't have any information about Apple being related to this sports article. If you could provide more context or clarify what you mean by "what is apple," I'd be happy to try and help!
