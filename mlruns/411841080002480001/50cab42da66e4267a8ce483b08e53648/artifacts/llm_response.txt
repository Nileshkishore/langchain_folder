I think there's been a mistake! There is no young and talented footballer named Virat Kohli. Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer, not a footballer.

However, if you'd like to ask about animals related to the story, I can try to help. Since there isn't much information about footballers or fields in the context of animals, I'll have to make an educated guess. Here are 5 animal names that might be relevant:

1. Lion
2. Panther
3. Tiger
4. Elephant
5. Falcon

Please let me know if you'd like more suggestions!
