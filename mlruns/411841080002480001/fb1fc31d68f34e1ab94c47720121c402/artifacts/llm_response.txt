I think there may be some confusion here!

Virat Kohli is actually a cricketer, not a footballer. He is an Indian international cricketer who has played for the India national team in various formats of the game, including Tests, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). He is widely regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world.

The story you provided seems to be about a footballer, not Virat Kohli. If you'd like to write another story or scenario featuring Virat Kohli in cricket, I'd be happy to help!
