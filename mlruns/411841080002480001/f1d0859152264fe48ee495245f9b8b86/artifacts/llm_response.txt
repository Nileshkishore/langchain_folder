I think there may be a bit of a mix-up here!

In the context of your question, I believe Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer (a fielder in the sport of cricket), not a footballer. He's widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game.

So, to correct my initial assumption: Virat Kohli is indeed a young and talented cricketer, known for his exceptional batting skills and leadership abilities.
