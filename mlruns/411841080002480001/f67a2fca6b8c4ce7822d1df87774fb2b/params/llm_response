There seems to be some confusion. In the context provided, there is no mention of Kapil Dev. However, I can tell you that Kapil Dev is a former Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest fast bowlers in cricket history and was also an accomplished captain of the India national team.

It appears that the story provided is actually about Virat Kohli, who is a famous Indian cricketer, not a footballer.
