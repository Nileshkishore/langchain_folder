This passage doesn't actually describe Virat Kohli as a footballer, but rather implies that he is a young athlete playing football (soccer). However, based on my knowledge, I can tell you that Virat Kohli is actually an Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He is a professional cricketer who has played for the Indian national team and is considered one of the best batsmen in the world.
