I think there's been a mistake! According to the context provided, Virat Kohli is not a footballer, but rather a young and talented cricketer (a player of cricket). He is known for his sharp footwork and unwavering determination on the field, but in this fictional scenario, he's actually playing football. In reality, Virat Kohli is a world-class batsman who has played cricket at the international level for India.
