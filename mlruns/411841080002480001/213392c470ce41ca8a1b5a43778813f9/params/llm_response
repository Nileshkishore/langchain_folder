There seems to be some confusion. In the context provided, there is no mention of PM Modi or any reference to him being involved in football.

It appears that the initial text describes Virat Kohli as a young athlete, but it's worth noting that Virat Kohli is actually a famous Indian cricketer, not a footballer. He has been a prominent figure in international cricket and has led India to several notable victories.

PM Modi, on the other hand, refers to Narendra Modi, who is the current Prime Minister of India.
